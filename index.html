<h1>My target</h1>
<img src="Knowledge worker.jpg" alt="Knowledge worker" width="500"height="300">
<p>I have to dedicate at least a couple of hours to web development each day and stick with the course of Fullstack development bootcamp 2023 of Udemy. This way, I can develop decent skills to become a website developer and land a job in a web develpoment company/software house.
  <br>
If I can do that, it would be something that would go a long way to boost my career and help me in the following ways:
  <ol>
    <li>Become a knowledge worker</li>
    <li>Have an extra skillset</li>
    <li>Have a new horizon in my professional career</li>
   </ol>
    <br>
This will involve building a lot of dicipline and self-regulation to mantain and keep on growing in this new field. If I put in the hours and keep on coding everyday, I will gain the necessary skills with time. 
   <br>
I am going to give myself a deadline of being able to do this in six months--starting from Feburary. This way I will have deadline and a clear end-goal in site.

  <h1>Tools I have available</h1>
    <p>The tools I have available are sufficient to help in my journey to becoming a web developer. The only thing I need to improve is the table height. That will increase my comfort level in a drastic way and help me in doing things I want to do. The things that I need to improve possibly can include:
      <ul>
        <li>Update my laptop</li>
          <ol>
            <li><a href="https://www.olx.com.pk/item/lenovo-thinkpad-laptop-t420t430t540pt440st450s-usedimporteddell-iid-1065588761">Lenovo T440</a>. The screen is 14 inches long and will help me a long way in increasing my productivity. 
              <li>Hp 840 G3
           </ol>
      <li>Ram of my laptop, upgrade to 8 GB. <a href="https://www.olx.com.pk/item/laptop-ram-ddr4-in-4gb-3200mhz-iid-1065412765">I can buy from here</a></li>
      <li>Perhaps get a watch (if I can afford it) 
        <a href="https://www.bhaotao.com/products/Casio-Mens-A158W-1.html#:~:text=Buy%20Casio%20Mens%20A158W%201%20only%20in%20pakistan%20Rs%203249</">Casio A158W 1</a>. This is suitable as it has an hourly alarm that can remind me to keep on working and the importance of time.</li>
<li>Get another course at udemy, however this course is sufficient for me to start and if I am able to finish it, I am sure I would have learned a great deal of stuff. 
  </ul>
 <br>
 This is a wonderful thing I am doing. I have to do this for the sake of my future and becoming a <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4842-4221-6_7#:~:text=Software%20developers%20are%20a%20specific,used%20to%20understand%20software%20developers."><strong>knowledge worker</strong></a>. Being a knowledge worker will ensure that I don't become redundant over time and have the necessary skills to keep-up with a very diverse and ever changing market. 
<br>
All I can say is that I have to do this in order to become a knowledge worker and gain a lot of confidence in my abilities and increase my earning potential in a drastic way.
